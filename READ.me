Hey so this is just a fun Java Game I coded in high school! The gist is that you are given a bunch of buttons that light up in
a random order - then the user must repeat this order back perfectly. As time goes on not only does the speed go faster but the
number of buttons that light up increase as well.

I basically used Java swing to help build the GUI and Java Action Listeners. It was a fun time! I did run into a few challenges 
integrating the Java timer but it all worked out in the end!
